# Lab 2

A note: My maiden name is Chisholm, I have been using 'O'Grady' at work for quite some time but since I did my undergrad at Dalhousie, they still have my maiden name. I have just recently seperated so you could say I'm 'in between' last names and trying to switch them all to be consistent.
